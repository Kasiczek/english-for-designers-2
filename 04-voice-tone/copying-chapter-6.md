## Copying 

## I love NY

I chose the I love NY logo because I think that this logo is known to almost everyone and is often copied.
I Love New York (stylized I ‚ù§ NY) is a slogan, a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign used since 1977 to promote tourism in the state of New York, including New York City.
The logo was designed by Milton Glaser, he made it in the taxi on the way to the meeting.
The original formo f this logo was drawn on the scrap paper with red crayon. 

This logo has become an absolute icon and is used all over the world.
Many tourists bring at least one piece from the city from each holiday.
The logo has also undergone several changes. People exchanged for something else, such as My dog <3 me and others.
Ideas for logo changes draw on an infinity of ideas, and many people adapt the text to exactly what they need.
But they are not the ones who invented the logo, they are just copying it.

New York has tried several times to add a trademark logo, thus stopping copying. By 2005, they had tried more than 3,000 times, each time in vain. 
After the September 11 Terrorist attacks, the logo has become even more of a symbol, creating unity between the public.
