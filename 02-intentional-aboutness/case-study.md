# Festival Bollywood


## Reincarnation
We chose interactive for our visual style and communication towards visitors
method of advertising in the form of cardboard figures of our heroes. This is the concept we want
to connect the spectator directly with the festival and literally allow him to continue into the new world.
We want to bring new experiences that people will be able to take home, for example, in form
photos on your phones and the team helped us spread the ad. The big advantage is so
evocation of emotions and direct connection with the festival, what are the two festivals that do not allow.

## Design of posters 

The first poster of the festival has two versions.
Both have several ideas in common.
The design is inspired by the Indian style of using posters
colors, photos, collages, retouches, 3D fonts, etc.

## Visual system in practice

The main visual element is not the poster, but the characters.
We will enable the visual system (festival) to spread around the online world.

Connecting the spectator with the festival,
raising awareness of the festival,
creating emotions and memories,
addressing a wider group of people (visitors and passers-by)interactivity
