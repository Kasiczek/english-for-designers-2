## Tereza Kodlová

My name is Terka and I am 22 years old. I studied at the grammar school of Professor Jan Patočka for eight years and then decided to continue at VŠKK. 
I've been doing graphic design for two and a half years now, so I'm a complete newcomer. 
In my free time I devote myself to large-scale painting and creating illustrations, my other hobby is also yoga. 
I would say that I am a really positive person and I really like to make new friends. 
I love company so I like to go to cafes, pubs, exhibitions, just about everywhere it lives. 
My other hobbies include studying German, I've been doing it for over ten years now, and one day I'd like to try living in Germany or Austria.
